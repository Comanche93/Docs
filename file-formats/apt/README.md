# APT

## Description

Apt files are flash based user interface files (based on the [SWF](https://www.mobilefish.com/download/flash/swf_file_format_spec_v9.pdf) 
file format created my Macromedia). Other than the SWF format the contents are splitted into multiple files, 
which are all in a single `.big` archive.

## Constant Data

The constant variables that are used for the GUI are all stored in a `.const` file. The specification of that 
format is described [here](CONST.md).
