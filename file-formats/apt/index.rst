APT
===

Description
-----------

Apt files are flash based user interface files (based on the `SWF <https://www.mobilefish.com/download/flash/swf_file_format_spec_v9.pdf>`_ 
file format created by Macromedia). Other than the SWF format the contents are splitted into multiple files, 
which are all in a single `.big` archive.

Constant Data
-------------

The constant variables that are used for the GUI are all stored in a ``.const`` file. :doc:`The specification of that 
format is described here <const>`.
